# EEG Exploration + Probabilistic Modeling

So with this little side project I would like to familiarize myself with common concepts of cognitive computing. Hence, I decided to explore an EEG dataset and train some bayesian models for it. 

## Goal
- A research-style exploration of open EEG data using Python (MNE).
- Learn preprocessing (filtering, ICA), visualization (ERPs, PSD), feature extraction, and a baseline classifier.
- Exploratory ERP analysis using MNE (MNE sample dataset).
- Single-trial amplitude extraction and a compact Bayesian two-group model to infer ERP amplitude differences.
